# importing-excel-columns-and-using-xlrd--xlwt---xlutils
Created to check a list for a names imported from another excel sheet into a txt document. used in my firm to quickly check for a file 
and label it accordingly rather than using ctrl f and searching manually. the xl import is used for older excel.
